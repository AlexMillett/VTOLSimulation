<h1>Vertical Takeoff Vehicle Simulation</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I coded the control theory algorithnms to similate a VTOL in 2 dimensions.  Minor adjustments could be made to control in three dimensions.  While I didn'tk write most of the code for displaying the VTOL, all of the dynamical components were solved and coded by me.  While it was more control theory focused, it was a fun project, and was very rewarding to see code work in the physical world.

To see the simulation, clone the repo and then run the simulation file.
